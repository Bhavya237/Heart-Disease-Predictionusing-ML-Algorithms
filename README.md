# Heart-Disease-Predictionusing-ML-Algorithms

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
Heart disease is the number one cause of death globally. Heart disease is concertedly contributed by hypertension, diabetes, overweight and unhealthy lifestyles.


Attribute Information:

*age
*sex
*chest pain type (4 values)
*resting blood pressure
*serum cholestoral in mg/dl
*fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
*resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
*maximum heart rate achieved
*exercise induced angina
*oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
*the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
*number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect


Through this project i have answered the following questions:


1. Importing the Libraries
2. Importing the Dataset
3. Taking Care of Missing Values
4. Taking Care of Duplicate Values
5. Data Processing
6. Encoding Categorical Data
7. Feature Scaling
8. Splitting The Dataset Into The Training Set And Test Set
9. Logistic Regression
10. SVC
11. KNeighbors Classifier
Non-Linear ML Algorithms
12. Decision Tree Classifier
13. Random Forest Classifier
14. Gradient Boosting Classifier


Finally predicting the best algorithm for prediction if the heart disease.
